## Lab 1: TempConverter and Stopwatch ##

1. If you have not done so already, go to the App Store and download Xcode version 9.2+. After installing, open Xcode and agree to license and download command line tools and other needed components (should happen automatically after agreeing to license). **This download/installation may take 20-30 minutes, so please be prepared**.

2. In a separate window, open up the [Xcode Shortcuts Cheat Sheet](http://67442.cmuis.net/files/67442/XcodeShortcuts.pdf) by Yong Bakos. Refer to this cheat sheet throughout this lab to begin to learn the basic layout of Xcode as well as keyboard shortcuts that you may find useful.
